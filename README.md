# Customer Churn Prediction using ANN & Streamlit

This project predicts whether a bank customer will churn using an Artificial Neural Network trained with TensorFlow/Keras and deployed using Streamlit.

## Features
- ANN model trained on bank customer data
- Label Encoding, One-Hot Encoding, Feature Scaling
- Streamlit web interface for live predictions

## Run the App

pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py

## Files
